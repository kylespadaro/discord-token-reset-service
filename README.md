# discord-token-reset-service
If your bot's token is listed on [this page](https://github.com/sodacova/discord-token-reset-service/blob/main/tokens.txt), unfortunately you leaked it at some point. I am posting it in this repository so Discord detects it and generates a new token for you.

Tokens allow anyone to connect to Discord using your bot's account, as a result you should not be sharing this with **anyone**.
